Assets to include and link into your application or service--to tell your users that:

* they own their data
* their data is encrypted before it leaves their browser
* they continue to have all the availability and reliability benefits of the cloud

All assets available in the [images/byod/ folder](images/byod/).

Keep in mind that these assets don't apply to [delegate data](delegation-subletting.md) access.  [Delegate data](delegation-subletting.md) access is necessary for ease of onboarding, usability, and convenience; but its use should be limited in scope and users should be encouraged to bring their own data.
