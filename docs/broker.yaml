    This is the API contract expected to be exposed by an overhide "broker".  This API is represented by the green "broker API" connector in the overhide component model:

    ![overhide component model](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/raw/master/docs/images/provided.png)

    To load this API into another [Swagger viewer/editor](https://editor.swagger.io) find [the GitHub *Swagger 2.0* definition file](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/broker.yaml) and import as YAML.

    Read this API with reference to the [glossary](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/glossary.md).

    ***
      A note on schemes used in the API.  All operations unless explicitly indicated use the HTTPS scheme.  The [backchannel-message/../subscribe/.. operation](#operation--backchannel-message-subscribe--segment-key--get) uses the WSS scheme.

      Authentication, authorization, and credential management:

      * authenticate providing an [access token](#security-definition-Authorization Header): authenticate subscribers of 
        the system and invitees of subscribers of the system.
      * work with  authority levels.
      * change *identity* credentials.  Setting *identity* for the first time is
      done with the [authenticate endpoint](#path--auth-authenticate).
      * work with subscription details for a supported remuneration API and a
      given *identity*.

        into an [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md).  The *shared-phrase* is equivalent to the
        *secret-phrase* passed into the [authenticate endpoint](#operation--auth-authenticate-put): except it's not kept secret by the 
        inviting user.  This is necessary to authorize the invitee to the inviting subscriber, and to ensure the inviting subscriber's 
        *user-address* does in fact hash to the desired indentity: we don't want to just pass the inviting subscriber's [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md),

        If the *datastore-key*'s *allow-publish* setting is "any", the *identity* in the authentication token must simply be valid: a valid broker system user is publishing.

        If data from the remote *GUID* cannot be extracted or in otherwise unavailable the message call fails with a

      The *identity* is valid, authenticated, with proper authorizations, but:

      1. the *identity* has no write or publish access to the valid *datastore-key*.
      1. the API request would exceed rates and limits as set out within the authorities at the current subscription plan.

  Authorization Header:

    description: |
      Provides an authentication token as retrieved with either the [authentication endpoint](#path--auth-authenticate)
      or the [invitee bouncer endpoint](#path--auth-bounce).

      The token returned by either call must be provided in an "Authorization" header to API calls secured with this security definition.

      The tokens are whitelisted by the *overhide* broker until revoked or expired (at broker's purview).  
      
      The token contains the *identity*--hashed in implementation specific ways--to help with access control for the rest of the API.

      Same as the Authorization Header security scheme except token is passed in a query parameter named *auth*.
